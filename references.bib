abstract = {Background
The study of microbial communities and their applications have been leveraged by advances in sequencing techniques and bioinformatics tools. The Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing by nanopores provides a portable and cost-efficient platform for sequencing assays. While this opens the possibility of sequencing applications outside specialized environments and real-time analysis of data, complementing the existing efficient library preparation protocols with streamlined bioinformatic workflows is required.
Results
Here we present NanoRTax, a Nextflow pipeline for nanopore 16S rRNA gene amplicon data that features state-of-the-art taxonomic classification tools and real-time capability. The pipeline is paired with a web-based visual interface to enable user-friendly inspections of the experiment in progress. NanoRTax workflow and a simulated real-time analysis were used to validate the prediction of adult Intensive Care Unit patient mortality based on full-length 16S rRNA sequencing data from respiratory microbiome samples.
Conclusions
This constitutes a proof-of-concept simulation study of how real-time bioinformatic workflows could be used to shorten the turnaround times in critical care settings and provides an instrument for future research on early-response strategies for sepsis.}

Typical demands include querying taxonomy identifier (TaxIds) by taxonomy names, querying complete taxonomic lineages by TaxIds, listing descendants of given TaxIds, and others. However, existed tools are either limited in functionalities or inefficient in terms of runtime. In this work, we present TaxonKit, a command-line toolkit for comprehensive and efficient manipulation of NCBI Taxonomy data. TaxonKit comprises seven core subcommands providing functions, including TaxIds querying, listing, filtering, lineage retrieving and reformatting, lowest common ancestor computation, and TaxIds change tracking. The practical functions, competitive processing performance, scalability with different scales of datasets and good accessibility can facilitate taxonomy data manipulations. TaxonKit provides free access under the permissive MIT license on GitHub, Brewsci, and Bioconda. The documents are also available at https://bioinf.shenwei.me/taxonkit/.}

abstract = {Plants have evolved with a plethora of microorganisms having important roles for plant growth and health. A considerable amount of information is now available on the structure and dynamics of plant microbiota as well as on the functional capacities of isolated community members. Due to the interesting functional potential of plant microbiota as well as due to current challenges in crop production there is an urgent need to bring microbial innovations into practice. Different approaches for microbiome improvement exist. On the one hand microbial strains or strain combinations can be applied, however, field success is often variable and improvement is urgently required. Smart, knowledge-driven selection of microorganisms is needed as well as the use of suitable delivery approaches and formulations. On the other hand, farming practices or the plant genotype can influence plant microbiota and thus functioning. Therefore, selection of appropriate farming practices and plant breeding leading to improved plant-microbiome interactions are avenues to increase the benefit of plant microbiota. In conclusion, different avenues making use of a new generation of inoculants as well as the application of microbiome-based agro-management practices and improved plant lines could lead to a better use of the plant microbiome. This paper reviews the importance and functionalities of the bacterial plant microbiome and discusses challenges and concepts in regard to the application of plant-associated bacteria.}

abstract = {The vast translucent oceans are teeming with microscopic life that drives significant life processes and elemental cycling on Earth. Yet how climate change will affect the functioning of this microbiome is not well understood. Moran reviews progress and the transformative discoveries made recently in marine microbiology that have led environmental, plant, animal, and even human microbiome research. Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aac8455 The microbiome of the largest environment on Earth has been gradually revealing its secrets over four decades of study. Despite the dispersed nature of substrates and the transience of surfaces, marine microbes drive essential transformations in all global elemental cycles. Much has been learned about the microbes that carry out key biogeochemical processes, but there are still plenty of ambiguities about the factors important in regulating activity, including the role of microbial interactions. Identifying the molecular “currencies” exchanged within the microbial community will provide key information on microbiome function and its vulnerability to environmental change.}}
